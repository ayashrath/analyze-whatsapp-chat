data is a dict with key:value as -> name_of_person:(list of tuple -> (date, time, message))

For android the messages are in format -> 11/08/22, 11:50 am - Ayash Rath: Hi!
While in iOS the messages are in format -> [11/08/22, 11:50:00 AM] Ayash Rath: Hi!
Note - The above are called by me "message records"

And the time can be in either 12 hr or 24 hr format
The date can be in US or UK format
All the above need to be taken into consideration

Right now only android, with 12 hr format and uk date format is taken into consideration
