## Limitations

- Required a mobile device, to export data
- It works only the data available by exporting data of chat from the mobile app, i.e., it will not work on the chat that has been cleared by the person exporting the chat
- It can't analyse data which may appear on your phone but not present in the exported txt file. For example - in the app we can see all the members present in the group, but here we can get list of all members who have their chat in the exported .txt file

## Building

### To make a single executable from project files

1. Open the build.py file located in tests directory.
2. Change the values of variables FILE_LST, MODULES_LST and BUILD_ON_UNIX_SYSTEM, if required.
3. Run the script, and you should get file - whatsapp-analyse-full.
4. If on macOS or Linux, to make them executable and use the shebang - `chmod +x whatsapp-analyse-full`.
5. For windows
    1. Install [PyInstaller](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller).
    2. Clone this repository.
    3. Then type this in command prompt or Powershell - `pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --console --clean whatsapp-analyse-full`.
    4. Then the .exe file can be found in the dist folder in the directory where you ran the above command.

## Features to add / Bugs to solve

- New flags, that are planned to be added
  - Poll data analysis - Shows details of polls that were present on the group
  - Graphical analysis - Gives graphical output of the analysis, on appropriate areas
  - Date and time analysis - Makes use of the date and time data available
  - Full analysis report return - Generates a full report in a single file, for sharing purposes
- Emoji count: Gives a count of emojis in default and total flags
- Improve word list - User inputs the amount of details he requires, 3 levels - simple list, list with counter, all
- Better data and scripts for testing - As currently there is no proper way for the program to be tested for validity
- Improve build.py
  - Remove inline comments (as the program is already removing other type of comments, so these should also get removed for uniformity)
  - Remove type hints (as some of its features only work in later versions, so some older versions can't execute the final script)
